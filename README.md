# Summary
This repo contains the layout JSON needed to make a BFO_9000 work with Vial.  You can use this JSON to compile the firmware for the board using the steps found on the [Vial Website](https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html).

I've also included an example layout as a starting point for people to use when configuring their layout in Vial.  The switches with no configuration exist because I have a few POS keycaps on the board.  The no-config switches can be configured to whatever you'd like if you're not going this route.
